# aaa_vlc
My VLC plugins for playing music directly off of websites

## Plugins list
### aaasoundcloud_api
This is required for all aaasoundcloud plugins due to the API changes to Soundcloud making it very tedious to be able to keep things under a single plugin file.

### aaasoundcloud
This is the original plugin for playing Soundcloud sets. It works self-contained for playing sets only.

### aaasoundcloud_single
Used for playing a single track from a track URL.

### aaasoundcloud_auser
A somewhat useless plugin for playing the last 1024 tracks a Soundcloud user has posted.

### bandcamp
The plugin which can play albums and track from Bandcamp.
